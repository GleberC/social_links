## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I used, on the suggestion of a colleague from 'Frontend Mentor', a screen percentage styling, and that way I managed to make the screen responsive in a simpler way.
I tried to use responsive tags in a way that they would be reusable for new projects.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<Main class="personal_box">
    <img id="photo" src="./assets/images/perfil_2024.jpg" alt="avatar">

    <h1 id="name">
      Gleber Cagnoni
    </h1>

    <h2>
      SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "Front-end Developer and Guitar Luthier."
    </h3>

    <ul class="social_list">

      <li class="box">
        <a href="https://github.com/GleberC">
          <button class="social_link" type="button">GitHub</button>
        </a>
      </li>
     
    </ul>


  </Main>
```
```css
body {  
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I am still working on CSS styles to improve my skills.
